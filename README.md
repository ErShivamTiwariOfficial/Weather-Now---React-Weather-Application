# Weather Now - React Weather Application

## Overview

Weather Now is a responsive, interactive weather web application built with React. It enables users to:

- Search weather by entering any place name with live autocomplete and location validation.
- Get current weather based on their exact device location using browser geolocation.
- View detailed, real-time weather data including temperature, wind speed, direction, and weather conditions.
- Experience dynamic animated backgrounds and smooth UI animations reflecting current weather.
- Enjoy a mobile-friendly and visually appealing interface optimized for all screen sizes.

The project leverages the Open-Meteo API for weather and geocoding data.
